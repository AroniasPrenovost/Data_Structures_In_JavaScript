	<p>What Are Data Structures?

		A way of organizing data that is stored in a computer or database. Each type of 
		data represents a different way of organizing the data that is stored. 

		Why are there different types?

		Each data structure has it's own strengths and weaknesses. 

		Some data strcyires are fast at storing and recording data, while others are 
		fast at searching and retrieiving data. 

		Why are these important to know? 

		Using data structures correctly can have a big impact on how performant, quick, and 
		efficiently programs run. 

		Example - 

		You work at Twitter and store old tweets in a database
		(constantly storing but not retrieiving)
		-You'll wan't to use a linked list that is fast at recording but 
		slow at retreiviing 

		if you want to store a bunch of recent tweets that allows people to 
		access them quickly, then you may want to use a hashtable. 

		Learning these concepts in JavaScript are key to reinforcing knowledge of 
		algorithms and other important programming concepts.
